# Gooch-Shading

This is an implementation of 1998 [paper](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ago820/SIG98/gooch98.pdf) about a non-photorealistic shader that aims to imitate the style of technical drawings. Personal modifications include: edges using inverted hull method and bling-phong lighting model instead of phong.
